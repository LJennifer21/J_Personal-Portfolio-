  <h1> Hello There! </h1>
  
  
  <p style="width: 800px;"> My name is Jennifer Lucero. I am a current student from San Jose State University pursing a Computer Science degree, as well as being first in my family to be going to University. </p>
  <br>
  <p style="width: 800px;"> I've always had curiosity about technology, especially when it came to coding! In fact, the first coding that I've experence was block coding. I strive to contiune honing my skills in Html/Css.

  </p>
  <br>
  <p style="width: 800px;">As a member of the Girls Who Code Club at SJSU, I was able to expand my knowledge of different coding lanagues as well as being able to utilze them to make my own future projects/creations. As a contiuning member, I express a passion of learning new things and exploring my tech journey outside of my courses.</p>
